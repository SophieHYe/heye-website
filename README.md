I received my Ph.D. degree in February 2023 at [KTH](https://www.kth.se/en) where I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Martin Monperrus](https://www.kth.se/profile/monp). My research interests include software testing, analysis, and trustworthy software construction. Particularly, my research focuses on automatic program repair and deep learning techniques for source code usage.

My research so far has included topics like automated patch generation and automated patch correctness assessment to identify overfitting patches generated by automatic repair systems.
